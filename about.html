  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Hi This is Dipansh. I approach technology as a system of ideas rather than a
    collection of tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    I prefer building from first principles, understanding
    constraints, and reasoning through trade-offs before
    implementing solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This mindset shapes how I learn databases, programming,
    and machine learning.Stay in touch this website in under process.
