    <h1>SQL Case Study: Subscription Billing System</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription-based businesses require a reliable way to manage
        customers, plans, billing cycles, and payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poorly designed systems often lead to duplicate charges,
        inconsistent records, and revenue leakage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Store customer and subscription data</li>
        <li>Support multiple subscription plans</li>
        <li>Track billing cycles and payment status</li>
        <li>Prevent duplicate or invalid billing entries</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The database is designed using normalized relational tables
        separating customers, plans, subscriptions, and payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, while
        data constraints prevent invalid states.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Logic</h2>
      <p>
        Business rules such as billing frequency and payment validation
        are enforced at the database level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stored procedures and triggers automate recurring actions
        and reduce the risk of human error.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This schema enables analysis of active subscriptions,
        revenue trends, failed payments, and churn indicators.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Trade-offs</h2>
      <p>
        Advanced billing scenarios such as proration, discounts,
        or multi-currency support are intentionally excluded
        to keep the system simple and reliable.
